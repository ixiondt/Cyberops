## HOW TO USE THIS INDEX

### By MDMP Phase
1. **Receipt of Mission** → ADP 5-0, FM 2-0 (threat baseline)
2. **Mission Analysis** → ATP 2-01.3 (cyberspace IPB), FM 3-12 (cyber terrain)
3. **COA Development** → FM 3-12, ATP 3-12.3 (cyber tasks & control measures)
4. **COA Analysis/Wargame** → JP 3-12 (joint friction), MITRE ATT&CK (threat COA indicators)
5. **COA Comparison** → ATP 5-0.2.1 (decision criteria), FM 3-13 (IO integration)
6. **Orders Production** → FM 3-12 Annex M, ATP 3-12.3 (cyber annex template & tasks)

### By Operational Question
- **"What are cyber tasks?"** → FM 3-12, ATP 3-12.3
- **"How do I build threat COAs?"** → ATP 2-01.3 (IPB), MITRE ATT&CK (tactics)
- **"How does cyber fit into joint ops?"** → JP 3-12, ADP 5-0
- **"What's our cyber terrain?"** → ATP 2-01.3, FM 3-12 (OAKOC in cyber)
- **"How do I write a cyber annex?"** → FM 3-12 (Annex M), ATP 3-12.3
- **"What indicators confirm/deny threat COA?"** → MITRE ATT&CK mapping, FM 2-0 (collection)

### By Role
- **S-2 / Intelligence Officer** → FM 2-0, ATP 2-01.3, MITRE ATT&CK
- **Cyber Operations Officer** → FM 3-12, ATP 3-12.3, JP 3-12

## QUICK CITATION FORMAT

When citing doctrine in responses, use:
- **ADP 5-0, Figure 3-1** (specific figure)
- **FM 3-12, Section 3-4** (section)
- **ATP 2-01.3, Appendix B** (appendix)
- **JP 3-12, Paragraph 3.b.1** (paragraph)

Example: *"Per ADP 5-0, Figure 3-1, the running estimate updates at each MDMP phase. Cyber running estimates should similarly track constraints/authorities, threat posture, and RFIs."*
