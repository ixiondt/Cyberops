## BLUF

A malware outbreak is a CAT I incident. Multiple systems are compromised or actively propagating. The priority is **simultaneous containment** of all identified infected hosts — not sequential analysis. Speed of containment determines final scope. Notify Mission OIC and ARCYBER immediately. This is an all-hands event.

**Trigger Criteria (ANY of the following):**
- 2+ hosts confirmed infected with the same malware
- EDR/SIEM shows active lateral movement correlated to malware
- Network scan shows malware propagation (worm behavior, SMB scanning, etc.)
- Rapid increase in alert volume across multiple hosts simultaneously

---

## STEP 1: PREPARATION

### 1.1 Required Capabilities (Pre-Incident)
| Capability | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| EDR with mass containment | Isolate multiple hosts simultaneously |
| SIEM with real-time correlation | Track spread, identify infected hosts in real time |
| Asset inventory (current) | Know what is in scope and what is critical |
| Network segmentation capability | Implement emergency VLAN isolation |
| Out-of-band communication channel | Coordinate response while network is impacted |
| Forensic capacity (multiple teams) | Parallel investigation across multiple hosts |
| Incident commander authority | Single decision-maker for speed |

### 1.2 Pre-Incident Posture Requirements
- [ ] EDR bulk containment action tested
- [ ] Emergency network segmentation procedure documented and tested
- [ ] VLAN/firewall change authority coordinated with network ops
- [ ] Mass credential reset procedure documented
- [ ] Backup restoration SLA documented per system criticality
- [ ] Out-of-band communication channel (voice, backup email) established

### 1.3 Outbreak Response Team Composition
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Incident Commander (Mission OIC) | All decisions, external reporting |
| Host Analysis Lead | Forensic analysis, eradication coordination |
| Network Analysis Lead | Spread tracking, C2 identification, boundary blocking |
| Systems/IT Ops | Network segmentation, credential resets, restores |
| Reporting Officer | Documentation, notification chain, SITREP |

---

## STEP 2: DETECTION & IDENTIFICATION

### 2.1 Outbreak Indicators
| Indicator | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|
| Multiple EDR alerts with identical malware signature in short timeframe | Propagating worm/outbreak |
| SMB scanning or pass-the-hash traffic from infected host | Active lateral movement |
| File share traffic anomalies (write activity across shares) | File-based propagation |
| Rapid increase in authentication failures | Credential brute force spreading |
| New scheduled tasks / services appearing on multiple hosts | Malware self-installing for persistence |
| DNS flood or broadcast traffic spike | Network worm scanning |

### 2.2 Outbreak Characterization (Complete Before Mass Containment)
Answer these questions to drive the right containment response:

1. **What is the propagation mechanism?**
   - Network worm (self-propagating via port scan/exploit)
   - Credential-based (using stolen creds to spread via RDP/SMB/WMI)
   - File share (malicious file in shared folder executed by multiple users)
   - Removable media

2. **What is the current blast radius?**
   - How many hosts confirmed infected?
   - What segments are affected?
   - Is OT/critical infrastructure in the blast radius?

3. **What is the malware doing beyond spreading?**
   - Ransomware (data encryption) → escalate immediately, speed is critical
   - C2 beaconing (reporting back, awaiting instructions)
   - Data collection / exfiltration
   - Destructive payload

4. **What is the propagation speed?**
   - Rapid (worm — seconds to minutes between new infections): Maximum urgency
   - Slow (credential-based — hours): Methodical response possible

### 2.3 Scope Mapping
Build the infected host list in real time:
```
INFECTED HOST TRACKER
| Hostname | IP | Function | Criticality | Infection Time | Status |
|----------|----|---------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:------:|
| [HOST1]  |    |          |             |                | Active |
| [HOST2]  |    |          |             |                | Active |
```

Continuously update this list throughout the response. The list drives containment priority.

### 2.4 Critical Path Hosts (Identify Immediately)
Determine which infected or potentially-infected hosts represent highest risk:
- Domain controllers
- Authentication servers / LDAP / AD
- Network management / monitoring systems
- OT interfaces / historians
- Backup systems (ransomware priority target)
- Mission-critical servers

**If any critical path host is infected or in spread path:** Notify Mission OIC + BN/BDE CDR immediately.

---

## STEP 3: CONTAINMENT

### 3.1 Containment Priority Framework
```
OUTBREAK CONTAINMENT PRIORITY
1. STOP THE SPREAD (network segmentation) — minutes 0-15
2. ISOLATE ALL CONFIRMED INFECTED HOSTS (EDR + network) — minutes 0-30
3. PROTECT UNINFECTED CRITICAL SYSTEMS (firewall/VLAN) — minutes 0-30
4. CREDENTIAL LOCKDOWN (if credential-based spread) — minutes 0-60
5. C2 BLOCK (if malware reporting out) — minutes 0-60
```

### 3.2 Short-Term Containment (0–30 Minutes)
**This is a simultaneous, not sequential, action set.**

- [ ] **Declare outbreak** — Mission OIC formally designates this as an outbreak response
- [ ] **Activate all-hands** — All available analysts on task
- [ ] **Mass EDR containment** — Isolate ALL confirmed infected hosts via EDR simultaneously
- [ ] **Emergency network segmentation** — Block east-west traffic between affected and clean segments
- [ ] **Block C2 at boundary** — Push emergency block rules to firewall/proxy for identified C2
- [ ] **Disable propagation accounts** — If credential-based, disable accounts observed spreading malware
- [ ] **Notify ARCYBER** — CAT I notification, 1-hour deadline from first confirmed host

### 3.3 Long-Term Containment (30 Minutes – Hours)
- [ ] **Enumerate all potentially exposed hosts** — Run EDR sweep across all segments for IOCs
- [ ] **Segment by infection status** — Confirmed clean, potentially exposed, confirmed infected
- [ ] **Apply enhanced monitoring** — Increase sensor sensitivity on clean segments
- [ ] **Freeze user credentials** — Domain-wide credential freeze if domain controller compromised
- [ ] **Activate backup communications** — If outbreak impacts primary comms channels
- [ ] **Establish operations log** — Centralized, time-stamped record of all response actions

### 3.4 Business Continuity Coordination
For each affected mission-critical system:
- Identify failover/backup option
- Assess mission impact of maintaining isolation
- Document any risk acceptance required to restore critical system before full eradication
- Mission OIC + BN Commander approval required for any exception to isolation

---

## STEP 4: ERADICATION

### 4.1 Eradication Sequencing
**Do NOT restore systems to network until all affected hosts are eradicated.**
- Prioritize eradication of critical systems first (DC, auth servers, mission-critical)
- Use clean build / reimage as default (not manual cleaning) for outbreak scale
- Rebuild from baseline image from BEFORE outbreak date

### 4.2 Eradication Actions (Per Host)
1. Confirm infected system fully isolated
2. Forensic image (for analysis, not required before eradication if already done during containment)
3. **Rebuild from clean image** (preferred) OR manual eradication if rebuild infeasible
4. Apply all patches (specifically patch the vulnerability used for initial access / propagation)
5. Rescan with updated malware signatures — confirm CLEAN
6. Verify no persistence mechanisms present

### 4.3 Network-Level Eradication
- [ ] Confirm all C2 IPs/domains blocked at all egress points (not just primary firewall)
- [ ] Remove any attacker-installed network tools / backdoors
- [ ] Reset all network device credentials (if network access was part of attack)
- [ ] Validate firewall/proxy rule integrity (confirm no attacker-modified rules)

### 4.4 Credential Eradication
- [ ] Reset all credentials that could have been exposed during outbreak window
- [ ] Rotate all service account passwords
- [ ] Rotate all privileged account credentials
- [ ] Revoke and reissue certificates if PKI infrastructure was affected
- [ ] Invalidate all active sessions (force re-authentication)
- [ ] Enable MFA where not already in place (as hardening step)

### 4.5 Eradication Validation Gate
**Before any system is restored to network:**
- [ ] Full rescan with updated signatures: CLEAN
- [ ] Persistence check: No malicious scheduled tasks / services / registry entries
- [ ] Process tree review: Normal
- [ ] Network connection check: No C2 callbacks
- [ ] Mission OIC sign-off on individual host restoration

---

## STEP 5: RECOVERY

### 5.1 Restoration Sequence (Priority Order)
1. Authentication infrastructure (DC / LDAP / AD) — everything else depends on this
2. Network management / monitoring (restore visibility)
3. Mission-critical servers (per supported organization priority)
4. Business-critical servers
5. User workstations (batch by department/function)

### 5.2 Recovery Validation (Per System)
- [ ] System reimaged from verified clean baseline
- [ ] Patched to current patch level before rejoining network
- [ ] EDR agent deployed and reporting
- [ ] Baseline scan post-restore: CLEAN
- [ ] Functional test: System performing intended function correctly
- [ ] System Owner / IT Ops sign-off

### 5.3 Graduated Network Restoration
**Do NOT restore all systems simultaneously.**
- Restore in batches
- Monitor each batch for 2-4 hours before restoring next
- Watch for re-infection indicators before expanding restoration

### 5.4 Post-Outbreak Monitoring
- Enhanced monitoring on all restored hosts (30-day minimum)
- Daily review of EDR telemetry from restored systems first week
- Any re-infection indicator → re-isolate and repeat eradication

## STEP 6: POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS

### 6.1 Outbreak Timeline Reconstruction
```
OUTBREAK TIMELINE TEMPLATE
[DATE/TIME] Patient zero: initial infection
[DATE/TIME] First propagation event detected
[DATE/TIME] Outbreak declared
[DATE/TIME] Mass containment initiated
[DATE/TIME] Spread stopped (last new infection)
[DATE/TIME] Eradication started
[DATE/TIME] Eradication complete (all hosts clean)
[DATE/TIME] Recovery started (first host restored)
[DATE/TIME] Full recovery complete
[DATE/TIME] Enhanced monitoring active
Total hosts affected: [N]
Total systems rebuilt: [N]
Estimated mission impact: [hours of disruption]
```

### 6.2 Root Cause Analysis (Required for CAT I)
Determine and document:
- Patient zero host and initial access method
- Why malware spread (credential reuse, flat network, missing patches)
- Why it wasn't stopped faster (detection gap, response gap, authority gap)
- What accelerated the spread (admin credential availability, network design)

### 6.3 Outbreak Lessons Learned (Mandatory for CAT I)
- [ ] Initial access vector — remediated or POA&M created
- [ ] Propagation method — architectural fix recommended
- [ ] Detection gap — new signatures/rules deployed
- [ ] Response gap — SOP updated
- [ ] Authority gap — pre-authorization expanded or escalation chain updated
- [ ] Architecture recommendation — segmentation, credential hygiene, EDR coverage

### 6.4 AAR Brief Topics
1. What was the outbreak (scope, malware type, duration)
2. What went right in the response
3. What went wrong or was slower than expected
4. What must change to prevent recurrence
5. What must change to improve response speed

## STEP 7: COORDINATION & REPORTING

### 7.1 Outbreak Reporting Timeline
| Event | Recipient | Deadline |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| First confirmed infection (CAT I) | Mission OIC | Immediately |
| CAT I notification | ARCYBER | Within 1 hour |
| Outbreak declared (2+ hosts) | BN/BDE CDR | Within 1 hour |
| System Owner notification | Per affected systems | Within 1 hour |

- [ ] All infected hosts identified and remediated
- [ ] Zero remaining malware indicators across entire environment
- [ ] All affected credentials rotated
- [ ] Initial access vulnerability patched
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring active (30-day window started)
- [ ] Final incident report submitted and acknowledged by ARCYBER
- [ ] AAR brief delivered to BN/BDE leadership
- [ ] Lessons learned incorporated into playbooks and architecture recommendations

## QUICK REFERENCE CARD

```
OUTBREAK RESPONSE PRIORITY ACTIONS (0-30 MINUTES)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. DECLARE OUTBREAK → Notify Mission OIC
2. MASS EDR CONTAINMENT → All confirmed infected hosts simultaneously
3. NETWORK SEGMENTATION → Block east-west to affected segments
4. C2 BLOCK → Push firewall rules for identified C2
5. CRED LOCKDOWN → Disable propagation accounts
6. NOTIFY ARCYBER → CAT I, within 1 hour

PATIENT ZERO IS NOT THE PRIORITY. STOPPING SPREAD IS.
FORENSICS CAN WAIT. CONTAINMENT CANNOT.
