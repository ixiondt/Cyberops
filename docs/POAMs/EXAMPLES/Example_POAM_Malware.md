## 1. FINDING SUMMARY

### Finding Title
Malware detected on endpoint WIN-USR-0847 with active C2 callback capability

### Finding Description
Endpoint WIN-USR-0847 (user: john.smith@domain.com) infected with malware Trojan.Win32.Emotet. EDR detection occurred on 2026-02-23 13:42 UTC during routine threat hunt. Memory analysis confirms DLL injection into multiple processes. Network telemetry shows C2 callback attempts to 203.0.113.50:443 at 5-minute intervals. Persistence mechanism: Registry Run key (HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run). Malware hash: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.

**Key Details:**
- **Asset/System Affected:** WIN-USR-0847 (Dell Latitude 7490, Windows 10 Pro Build 19044)
- **Affected User/Organization:** john.smith@domain.com, Finance Department
- **Discovery Method:** EDR threat detection + hunt correlation
- **Discovery Date/Time:** 2026-02-23 13:42 UTC
- **Analyst/Team:** CPT Avalon (Host Analyst), Team Lead: LTC Martinez

### Original Finding Source
Identified during hunt for Emotet indicators per CTI report Op-Guardian-CTI-023. EDR alert generated on process injection into svchost.exe.

## 2. RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Priority
**☑ CRITICAL** (Immediate action required - within hours)
**☐ HIGH** (Urgent action required - within 24-72 hours)
**☐ MEDIUM** (Planned action required - within 7-14 days)
**☐ LOW** (Standard action - within 30+ days)

### Risk Classification
**Finding Category:** ☑ Malware
- ☐ Compromised Credential
- ☐ Lateral Movement
- ☐ Configuration Deficiency
- ☐ Detection Gap
- ☐ Vulnerability/Exposure
- ☐ Process/Procedure Gap
- ☐ Incomplete Investigation

### Risk Scoring (NIST SP 800-30 Methodology)

**Likelihood (1-5):** 5
*Rationale: Known threat (Emotet), active C2 callback confirmed, persistence mechanism active, high likelihood of recurrence without removal*

**Impact (1-5):** 5
*Rationale: User-level malware with C2 capability, potential for lateral movement using user credentials, financial data access possible, mission-critical Finance Department asset*

**Overall Risk = Likelihood × Impact = 5 × 5 = 25 (CRITICAL)**

### Threat Context
Emotet is known to target financial institutions and government networks. This instance likely downloaded during phishing campaign per recent CTI report. Capabilities demonstrated: persistence, C2 communication, probable credential theft. Threat actor demonstrated ability to target this domain via phishing. Lateral movement possible using compromised credentials. High probability of recurrence without complete eradication and user training.

## 3. REMEDIATION APPROACH

### Remediation Strategy
Endpoint will be isolated from network (already done), malware sample collected for forensic analysis, endpoint will be re-imaged with clean Windows 10 Pro image and standard security baseline per AR 25-2, all user files will be migrated to new image, endpoint will be validated clean through EDR scanning, 30-day enhanced monitoring will be active, user will receive phishing awareness training, and mailbox will be audited for suspicious forwarding rules.

### Remediation Owner
**Primary Owner:** CPT Avalon (Host Analyst, Host Team)
**Backup Owner:** SFC Martinez (Senior Systems Administrator)
**Coordinator:** LTC Williams (Element Lead)
**Stakeholders:**
- John Smith (affected user)
- Finance Department leadership
- S-1 Identity Management (credential audit)
- S-2 Intelligence (threat intel tracking)

### Authority & Approval
**Required Authority:** Element Lead (LTC Williams)
- ☑ Element Lead approval obtained (LTC Williams approved 2026-02-23 14:15 UTC)
- ☐ Commander approval (if residual risk acceptance needed) — Not required, straightforward remediation
- ☐ External approvals: None required

**Authority Notes:** Finance Department Director (COL Johnson) notified per SOP. User's manager (Ms. Chen) notified. No policy exceptions or special authority needed.

- User confirms access to required files and applications
- User confirms network/internet connectivity
- User acknowledges training completion

### Rollback Plan

**Rollback Trigger:** Endpoint exhibits suspicious behavior within 48 hours of reimage (malware re-detection, behavioral anomalies, or EDR alert of known malware)

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Immediately isolate endpoint from network
2. Notify Element Lead and backup owner (SFC Martinez)
3. Attempt live analysis to identify issue (reinstalled malware, new persistence, etc.)
4. If successful reinfection confirmed: perform second reimage with additional security hardening
5. If technical issue (configuration error, hardware incompatibility): troubleshoot and fix
6. Resume monitoring upon completion

**Rollback Owner:** SFC Martinez (primary) or CPT Avalon (if malware-related)

**Estimated Rollback Time:** 4-6 hours (if full reimage needed) or 1-2 hours (if troubleshooting issue)

## 6. RESIDUAL RISK

### Risk Remaining After POAM Closure

**Description:**
Threat actor (likely Emotet campaign operator) has knowledge of john.smith's email address and may attempt reinfection via targeted phishing. Emotet is known to target organization repeatedly over months. User may still fall victim to similar phishing attacks. Other endpoints in Finance Department may also be targets.

**Specific Residual Risks:**
1. **Credential Knowledge Risk:** Threat actor may know username and past credential. Mitigated by password reset and monitoring.
2. **Email Targeting Risk:** User's email may be in compiled targeting list. Mitigated by email gateway phishing filters and user training.
3. **Similar Malware Risk:** Similar malware family may be deployed. Mitigated by EDR detection rules and user awareness.
4. **Lateral Movement Historical Risk:** Any lateral movement during infection period may have left backdoors. Mitigated by endpoint detection, 30-day monitoring.

### Residual Risk Acceptance

**Accepted By:** LTC Williams (Element Lead)
**Acceptance Date:** 2026-02-23 14:20 UTC

**Acceptance Rationale:**
Residual risk is acceptable because:
1. Clean reimage significantly reduces reinfection probability (70% → 5%)
2. Enhanced monitoring will detect any reinfection within hours
3. EDR detection rules for Emotet deployed across network
4. User training reduces phishing susceptibility
5. Password reset prevents credential reuse by threat actor

**Monitoring Plan:**
- **Monitor for:** Attempted Emotet C2 callbacks, phishing emails to john.smith, suspicious process injection, unauthorized lateral movement attempts
- **Using tool/source:** EDR console (primary), SIEM (secondary), Email gateway logs (tertiary)
- **Alerting threshold:** Immediate alert on any known IOC or behavioral match to Emotet, Daily SIEM correlation check
- **Review frequency:** Daily during active incident response phase (days 1-7), Weekly during post-incident phase (days 8-37), Normal baseline after 30-day period

**Escalation Trigger:**
- Any reinfection detected within 30 days: Escalate to commander, re-assess threat actor capabilities
- Pattern of targeting (3+ attempts within 30 days): Escalate to S-2 for organization-wide threat assessment
- Lateral movement detected during monitoring: Escalate immediately as new incident
