# NICE Framework Alignment
## Army Cyber Roles ↔ NIST NICE Work Roles

**File:** `nice-alignment.md`  
**Purpose:** Align Army cyber roles to the **NIST NICE Framework (SP 800-181 rev.1)** using role-based capabilities (not tools or techniques).  
**Use cases:** Workforce planning, joint/interagency alignment, training design, readiness discussions.

**Reference Framework:** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## Alignment Principles

- This is a **functional alignment**, not a one-to-one MOS replacement.
- Focuses on **capabilities and responsibilities**, not certifications or vendors.
- Supports **agnostic reuse** across missions and organizations.

## 1) 17C Host Analyst → NICE Work Roles

### Primary NICE Roles

| NICE ID | NICE Role Title | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **PR-CDA-001** | Cyber Defense Analyst | Core host-based detection, analysis, and reporting |
| **PR-INF-001** | Infrastructure Support Specialist | Host configuration awareness and baseline assessment |

### Supporting NICE Roles

| NICE ID | NICE Role Title | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| PR-MAL-001 | Malware Analyst | Artifact recognition and behavior assessment |
| PR-IR-001 | Incident Responder | Host-level evidence and scoping support |

**NICE Categories:**  
- **Protect & Defend (PR)** — Primary  
- **Operate & Maintain (OM)** — Supporting

---

## 2) 17C Network Analyst → NICE Work Roles

### Primary NICE Roles

| NICE ID | NICE Role Title | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **PR-CDA-001** | Cyber Defense Analyst | Network-centric detection and analysis |
| **PR-NET-001** | Network Operations Specialist | Network behavior and architecture awareness |

### Supporting NICE Roles

| NICE ID | NICE Role Title | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| PR-IR-001 | Incident Responder | Network scoping and containment support |
| AN-TWA-001 | Threat/Warning Analyst | Pattern recognition and anomaly correlation |

**NICE Categories:**  
- **Protect & Defend (PR)** — Primary  
- **Analyze (AN)** — Supporting

---

## 3) Cyber Operations Planner → NICE Work Roles

### Primary NICE Roles

| NICE ID | NICE Role Title | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **OV-PLN-001** | Cyber Policy and Strategy Planner | Cyber integration into MDMP/JOPP |
| **OV-MGT-001** | Cyber Workforce Planner | Capability and risk articulation to leadership |

### Supporting NICE Roles

| NICE ID | NICE Role Title | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| AN-TWA-001 | Threat/Warning Analyst | Threat COA and CTI translation |
| SP-RSK-001 | Risk Management Specialist | Mission-level cyber risk framing |

**NICE Categories:**  
- **Oversee & Govern (OV)** — Primary  
- **Analyze (AN)** — Supporting  
- **Securely Provision (SP)** — Supporting (planning context)

---

## 4) Crosswalk — Army Roles to NICE Categories

| Army Role | NICE Categories |
|---|---|
| 17C Host Analyst | PR (Primary), OM |
| 17C Network Analyst | PR (Primary), AN |
| Cyber Operations Planner | OV (Primary), AN, SP |

---

## 5) Practical Use

- **Workforce Planning:** Translate Army cyber capabilities into federal NICE language.  
- **Training Design:** Identify gaps by NICE role/category without vendor lock-in.  
- **Joint/Interagency Ops:** Align terminology with civilian partners using NICE.  
- **Career Pathing:** Natural progression from **PR → AN → OV**.

---

## 6) Intentional Exclusions

- Vendor tools or specific techniques  
- Certification mapping  
- Exploit development roles

These belong in **training plans**, not role definitions.

---

## 7) Bottom Line

This alignment enables precise statements like:  
> “This Army cyber role maps to NICE work roles X and Y, with primary emphasis on category Z.”

Use it to brief leaders, justify billets, and standardize language across organizations.
